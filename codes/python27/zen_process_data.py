This code will down load Z3D files from a Zen that is in SD Mode, 
convert the Z3D files to ascii format, then process them for each
sampling rate using Alan Chave's BIRRP code.  The outputs are then
converted to .edi files and plotted.

You need 2 things to run this code:
    * mtpy --> a Python package for MT and can be found at
	           https://github.com/geophysics/mtpy
    * BIRRP executable --> you can get this from Alan Chave at WHOI if you are 
                	          using it for non-commercial projects.
                           
..note:: This code is quite specific to my setup, so let me know what doesn't 
         work for you so I can generalize it.

    Arguments
    ----------------
        **survey_dir** : string
                         full path to the directory where you are storing 
                         the station data.  ie. /home/MT/Survey_00
                         
        **station** : string
                      name of the station you are down loading.
                      *default* is 'mt000'
                      
        **copy_date** : string
                        copy all files on and after this date
                        format is YYYY-MM-DD
                        *default* is None, which copies all files on the SD
                        cards.
                                  
        **birrp_exe** : string
                        full path to the BIRRP executable on your machine
                        *default* is the location on my machine
        
        **ant_calibrations** : string
                               full path to a folder that contains the coil
                               calibration data.  These must be in seperate
                               .csv files for each coil named by corresponding
                               coil name. If you're coil is 2884, then you
                               need a calibration file named Ant2884_cal.csv
                               in which the data is freq,real,imaginary 
                               
    Returns
    -----------------
        **rp_plot** : mtpy.imaging.plotnresponses object
                      ploting object of data, if you want to change how the
                      output is plot change the attributes of rp_plot
