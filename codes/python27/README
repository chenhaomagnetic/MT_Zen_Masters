This is a directory to place Python 2.7 codes to use with anything ZEN.Python is great for for most things because its free, wellsupported, platform independent, free, and easy to use.Most of the codes in this folder need the basic packages of Python	* numpy 1.8 or greater	* scipy 0.9 or greater 	* matplotlib 1.3 or greater	* and more, that I'll put up later	Also the codes are written in Python 2.7 so be sure your local version is some flavor of 2.7The other package that most of the codes use is MTpy: (https://github.com/geophysics/mtpy), where the useful modules for ZEN are under mtpy.usgs.zen and mtpy.usgs.zonge
